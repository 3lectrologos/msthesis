\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:intro}
Many information gathering problems 
%It is often the case in practical applications, that we are primarily
%interested in 
require accurately determining the regions where the value of some
unknown function lies above or below a given threshold level.
%, whereas
% modeling the precise behavior of the function inside those regions is of
%secondary concern. 
Moreover, evaluating the function is usually a costly
procedure and the measurements returned are noisy.

As a concrete example of such an application, consider the task of
monitoring a lake environment (in our case Lake Zurich) for algal bloom,
a phenomenon that is potentially harmful to other organisms of the ecosystem.
One way to accomplish this is by
determining the regions of the lake where the levels of algae-produced
chlorophyll (see \figref{fig:limno_chl}) or the concentration of the algae
themselves (see \figref{fig:limno_bgape}) lie above some threshold
value determined by field experts.
These regions can be estimated by sampling
at various locations of the lake using a mobile sensing device.
However, each measurement is costly in terms of time and sensor battery power,
therefore the sampling locations have to be picked carefully, in order to
reduce the total number of measurements required.

Other example applications in the context of environmental
monitoring~\cite{rahimi04} include estimating level sets of quantities
such as solar radiation, humidity, etc., and determining
the extent of hazardous phenomena, e.g. air pollution or
oil spills~\cite{galland04}.
In a different category are applications that consist in determining
the subset of a
parameter space that represents ``acceptable'' hypotheses~\cite{bryan05} or
designs~\cite{ramakrishnan05}.

We pose the problem of estimating some function level set as a
classification problem to be solved using \emph{active learning}.
In particular, we study the problem of classifying points into
a super- and a sublevel set with respect to some given threshold level
by making sequential decisions of the next sampling location at each
time step given all previous measurements.
For solving this problem, we propose the \fullacl (\acl) algorithm,
which utilizes Gaussian processes~\cite{rasmussen06} to model the target
function and exploits inferred variance estimates to create confidence bounds
and drive the selection process.
We also provide an information-theoretic bound
on the number of measurements needed to achieve a certain accuracy
when the underlying function is sampled from a known Gaussian process.

\figref{fig:limno_chl_res} shows an example of estimated super- and sublevel
sets resulting from running \acl on the chlorophyll concentration dataset of
\figref{fig:limno_chl} for a specified threshold level. Intuitively, \acl works
by progressively classifying
points into the super- and sublevel sets and, at the same time, sampling
at regions of high ``ambiguity'', i.e. regions where there is high
uncertainty about whether the value of the function lies above or below
the specified threshold level. As a consequence, the vast majority of
the sampled locations are concentrated near the level set to be estimated.

We also extend the \acl algorithm to two more settings that
naturally arise in practical applications.
In the first setting, we do not a priori have a specific threshold level
at our disposal, but would still like to perform level set estimation with
respect to an \emph{implicit} level that is expressed as a percentage
of the function maximum. In the environmental monitoring application outlined
above, we might want to estimate regions of relatively high algae
concentration, where what is considered as ``high'' concentration might
depend on the season of the year or other environmental factors. Using
an implicit level gives us a way to obtain useful information
without the need to hardcode a prespecified threshold level of interest
into the algorithm.

\figref{fig:limno_bgape_res} shows the estimated super- and sublevel sets
resulting from running \acl on the algae concentration dataset of
\figref{fig:limno_bgape} using an implicit threshold level of $75\%$ of
the maximum. The element of gradual classification of the explicit
threshold algorithm is also present in the implicit version, but there is
an additional
complexity of estimating the function maximum in order to obtain accurate
estimates of the implicit level. Therefore, while the algorithm still
focuses on the ``ambiguous'' regions of the input space, at the same time
it also heavily samples near the regions of the function maxima.

The second extension we propose applies to both the explicit and implicit
versions of the algorithm and aims at selecting at each step a \emph{batch} of
next samples, rather than just one sample at a time. A reason for doing so is
that, in problems such as the lake sensing example outlined above,
apart from the cost of actually taking each measurement, we
also have to take into account the cost incurred by traveling from one
sampling location to the next. Traveling costs can be dramatically reduced,
if we plan ahead by selecting multiple points at a time. Another reason is
that some problems allow for running multiple function evaluations in
parallel, in which case selecting batches of points can lead to a
significant increase in sampling throughput.

\paragraph{Contributions}
The main contributions of this thesis can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We introduce the \acl algorithm for sequentially estimating level sets
      of unknown functions.
\item We extend \acl to select samples in batches and present a straightforward
      application of batch sampling for path planning.
\item We consider for the first time the problem of estimating level sets under
      implicitly defined threshold levels and propose an extension of \acl
      for this problem.
\item We prove theoretical convergence bounds for \acl and its two
      extensions when the target function is sampled from a known GP.
\item We evaluate \acl and its extensions on three real-world datasets and show
      that our proposed algorithms are competitive with the state-of-the-art.
\end{itemize}
