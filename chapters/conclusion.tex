\chapter{Conclusion} \label{sect:conclusion}

%There are a number of shortcomings when applying the above batch-based method
%in practice. First, since selection of the batch is decoupled from its
%evaluation, there is no way to adapt the path during sampling of the points
%in the TSP path.\footnote{An alternative would be to each time sample the first
%point in the TSP path and then replan using a new batch. However, this fails
%because it does not give enough incentive to explore areas of the input space
%that lie far away from the current position.} Second, additional samples can be obtained while traveling from one location
%to another, but there is no easy way to incorporate this when planning using
%batches.
%Finally, as can be seen in the example of \figref{fig:limno_bgape_ppbatch}
%the resulting TSP path may contain several abrupt changes of direction that
%are not achievable in practice due to kinematic constraints of the mobile
%sensor equipment.
